**Who are we?**

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>We are young Indonesian educators, who are enlightened by NASA's Next-Gen STEM. It inspired us to design learning materials to motivate students and teachers holistically. </p>

**What are we working on?**

<p>Nasantara (short from NASA & Nusantara) is an Open Educational Resources (OER) of Hybrid Traditional Games-Based Instructional Design for Teachers in Indonesia. Teachers will have access to teaching materials about NASAâ€™s mission & research  that have been transformed into engaging traditional games for non-english learners amplifying science with art of representations to act as a medium for learning.</p>
