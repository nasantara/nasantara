**Who are we?**

Hello!

We are young Indonesian educators, who are enlightened by NASA's Next-Gen STEM. It inspired us to design learning materials to motivate students and teachers holistically. 

**What are we working on?**

Nasantara (short from NASA & Nusantara) is an Open Educational Resources (OER) of 
Hybrid Traditional Games-Based Instructional Design for Teachers in Indonesia. 
Teachers will have access to teaching materials about NASAâ€™s mission & research 
that have been transformed into engaging traditional games for non-english learners
amplifying science with art of representations to act as a medium for learning.
