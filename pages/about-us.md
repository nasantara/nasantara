##Who are we?

Hello!

We are [*NASANTARA Team*] We, young Indonesian educators, are enlightened by NASA's Next-Gen STEM. It inspired us to design learning materials to motivate students and teachers holistically. 

##What are we working on?
Nasantara (short from NASA & Nusantara) is an Open Educational Resources (OER) of Hybrid Traditional Games-Based Instructional Design for Teachers in Indonesia. 
Teachers will have access to teaching materials about NASAâ€™s mission & research that have been transformed into engaging traditional games for non-english learners, amplifying science with art of representations to act as a medium for learning.
