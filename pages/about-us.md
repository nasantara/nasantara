<p>Hello!</p>

<p>We are young Indonesian educators, who are enlightened by NASA's Next-Gen STEM. 
It inspired us to design learning materials to motivate students and teachers holistically. </p>


**What are we working on?**

<p>Nasantara (short from NASA & Nusantara) is an Open Educational Resources (OER)
of Hybrid Traditional Games-Based Instructional Design for Teachers in Indonesia. 
Teachers will have access to teaching materials about NASAâ€™s mission & research
that have been transformed into engaging traditional games for non-english
learners amplifying science with art of representations to act as a medium for learning.</p>
